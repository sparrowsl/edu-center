## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development. See deployment for notes on how to deploy the project on a live system.

### Prerequisites

What things you need to install the software and how to install them

- Node (16+ recommended)
- basic Solidjs knowledge (or React)

### Installing

Install dependencies
```bash
$ npm install # or pnpm install or yarn install
```

In the project directory, you can run:
> `npm dev` or `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br>
Open [http://localhost:5173](http://localhost:5173) to view it in the browser.

## Deployment

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `dist` folder.<br>
It correctly bundles Solid in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.<br>
Your app is ready to be deployed!

> You can deploy the `dist` folder to any static host provider (netlify, surge, now, etc.)
